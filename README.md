# Breast_cancer_diagnosis_with_Logistic_Regression
A breast cancer dataset often refers to the "Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset," which is commonly used in machine learning for classification tasks like logistic regression. This dataset contains features extracted from breast cancer biopsies and is used to predict whether a tumor is malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous).

Here's a brief overview of what you'll typically find in this dataset:

Features: These include various measurements taken from a cell nucleus, such as radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, and more.

Target variable: The target variable indicates whether a tumor is malignant (M) or benign (B).

In logistic regression, you can use this dataset to build a model that predicts the probability of a tumor being malignant based on the provided features. The logistic regression model helps classify tumors into one of the two categories (M or B) by finding the best-fit curve that separates them.
