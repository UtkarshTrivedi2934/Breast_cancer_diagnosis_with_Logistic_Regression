# Breast_cancer_diagnosis_with_Logistic_Regression
A breast cancer dataset often refers to the "Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset," which is commonly used in machine learning for classification tasks like logistic regression. This dataset contains features extracted from breast cancer biopsies and is used to predict whether a tumor is malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous).
